## My process

The idea was to write a single main HTML page containing several sections:

- HOME - A title, a caption with a typewriter effect and a button to the next section.
- ABOUT ME - A brief description of who I am and how I work, interspersed with spatial-themed illustrations.
- SKILLS - My list of soft and hard skills decorated by an animation.
- PROJECTS - My personal projects represented as cards, divided by sector.
- CONTACTS - Links to my socials and a form to message me.
